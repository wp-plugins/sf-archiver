A simple way to display archive pages for your custom post types

== Description ==
This plugin adds a box to your Menus admin page. With this you can add in your menus a link to your public custom post types (their archive page).

If a custom post type doesn't have an archive page, you can enable it by going to *Settings* > *SF Archiver*.
You can also change the slugs in the url, create an RSS feed link, customize the number of posts per page, or even add your custom post types to your home page.

= Translations =
* English
* French

== Installation ==

1. Extract the plugin folder from the downloaded ZIP file.
2. Upload SF Archiver folder to your *"/wp-content/plugins/"* directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the "Plugins" page.
4. Go to *Settings* > *SF Archiver* and do your stuff.
5. Go to *Appearance* > *Menus* and add the links to your menus.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why some of my custom post types don't appear in the settings page? =
They're probably not public.
